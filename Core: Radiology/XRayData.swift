    overviewText: "Large bowel obstruction is much less common than small bowel obstruction. Most cases are caused by colon cancer, acute diverticulitis, or a volvulus. Patients typically present with abdominal distention and pain as well as failure to pass stool or flatus.",
    findingsText: "The most common finding on abdominal X-ray is colonic distention greater than 6cm, or cecal distention greater than 9 cm. If the colon has infarcted gas may be seen in the colonic wall, a finding known as pneumatosis coli, or there may be free abdominal gas.",
    managementText:"Surgery is typically required, especially if the colon has infarcted or there is a mass lesion causing the obstruction."

    injuryAttribution: ["Case courtesy of Dr Ahmed Abd Rabou\nRadiopaedia.org, rID: 35721"],
    overviewText: "Small bowel obstruction is about 4 times more common than large bowel obstruction. The most common causes are adhesions from prior abdominal surgery, incarcerated hernias, and cancer, but there are many other potential causes. Patients usually present with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting.",
    findingsText: "The classic findings on abdomnial plain films are loops of small bowel dilated to more than 3 cm containing air-fluid levels. Abdominal X-rays will only detect about half of all SBOs, so if your clinical suspicion is high, get a CT.",
    managementText:"Aggressive fluid resusciation, NG tube placement, analgesia, antiemetics, and surgery consultation are the mainstays of early management. Surgery is indicated for a strangulated SBO, because the blood supply to the bowel is compromised."
